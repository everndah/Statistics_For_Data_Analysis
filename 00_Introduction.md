        - (Quantitative)Numerical DataType
.
Eg. Continuous , Discrete
            - Continuous Data
                - Interval Scales
                - Ratio Scales
        - (
Qualitative)Categorical Data Type
Eg. Binary Data(dichotomous data and indicator variables),Ordinal Data
            - Ordinal Data
                - Overall Statement(Poor to Excellent)
